      # When set in a response, a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a

      # Note that this does not necessary imply that the response may not be
      # stored by the cache, only that the cache cannot serve it without first
      # making a conditional GET request with the origin server.
      #
      # When set in a request, the server MUST NOT use a cached copy for its
      # response. This has quite different semantics compared to the no-cache
      # directive on responses. When the client specifies no-cache, it causes
      # an end-to-end reload, forcing each cache to update their cached copies.

      # Indicates that the response MUST NOT be stored under any circumstances.
      #
      # The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the
      # inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information (for
      # example, on backup tapes). The no-store directive applies to the
      # entire message, and MAY be sent either in a response or in a
      # request. If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of
      # either this request or any response to it. If sent in a response,
      # a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this response or the
      # request that elicited it. This directive applies to both non-
      # shared and shared caches. "MUST NOT store" in this context means
      # that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in
      # non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to
      # remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as
      # possible after forwarding it.
      #
      # The purpose of this directive is to meet the stated requirements
      # of certain users and service authors who are concerned about
      # accidental releases of information via unanticipated accesses to
      # cache data structures. While the use of this directive might
      # improve privacy in some cases, we caution that it is NOT in any
      # way a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy. In
      # particular, malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or
      # obey this directive, and communications networks might be
      # vulnerable to eavesdropping.

      # The expiration time of an entity MAY be specified by the origin
      # server using the Expires header (see section 14.21). Alternatively,
      # it MAY be specified using the max-age directive in a response. When
      # the max-age cache-control directive is present in a cached response,
      # the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age
      # value given (in seconds) at the time of a new request for that
      # resource. The max-age directive on a response implies that the
      # response is cacheable (i.e., "public") unless some other, more
      # restrictive cache directive is also present.
      #
      # If a response includes both an Expires header and a max-age
      # directive, the max-age directive overrides the Expires header, even
      # if the Expires header is more restrictive. This rule allows an origin
      # server to provide, for a given response, a longer expiration time to
      # an HTTP/1.1 (or later) cache than to an HTTP/1.0 cache. This might be
      # useful if certain HTTP/1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or
      # expiration times, perhaps due to desynchronized clocks.
      #
      # Many HTTP/1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that
      # is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent
      # to the Cache-Control response directive "no-cache". If an HTTP/1.1
      # cache receives such a response, and the response does not include a
      # Cache-Control header field, it SHOULD consider the response to be
      # non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP/1.0 servers.
      #
      # When the max-age directive is included in the request, it indicates
      # that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no
      # greater than the specified time in seconds.

      # also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive. i.e.,
      # that the shared cache must not use the entry after it becomes stale
      # to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with
      # the origin server. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a

      # directive, the s-maxage directive, or the Expires header. The r-maxage
      # directive also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive.
      # i.e., that the reverse cache must not use the entry after it becomes
      # stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it
      # with the origin server. The r-maxage directive is always ignored by

      # Because a cache MAY be configured to ignore a server's specified
      # expiration time, and because a client request MAY include a max-
      # stale directive (which has a similar effect), the protocol also
      # includes a mechanism for the origin server to require revalidation
      # of a cache entry on any subsequent use. When the must-revalidate
      # directive is present in a response received by a cache, that cache
      # MUST NOT use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a
      # subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin
      # server. (I.e., the cache MUST do an end-to-end revalidation every
      # time, if, based solely on the origin server's Expires or max-age
      # value, the cached response is stale.)
      #
      # The must-revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable
      # operation for certain protocol features. In all circumstances an
      # HTTP/1.1 cache MUST obey the must-revalidate directive; in
      # particular, if the cache cannot reach the origin server for any
      # reason, it MUST generate a 504 (Gateway Timeout) response.
      #
      # Servers SHOULD send the must-revalidate directive if and only if
      # failure to revalidate a request on the entity could result in
      # incorrect operation, such as a silently unexecuted financial
      # transaction. Recipients MUST NOT take any automated action that
      # violates this directive, and MUST NOT automatically provide an
      # unvalidated copy of the entity if revalidation fails.

      # The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must-

      # user agent caches. It can be used on a response to an
      # authenticated request to permit the user's cache to store and
      # later return the response without needing to revalidate it (since
      # it has already been authenticated once by that user), while still
