<h2>General</h2>

<h3>Q: Can I use Rack::Cache with Rails?</h3>

<p>Rack::Cache can be used with Rails 2.3 or above. Documentation and a
sample application is forthcoming; in the mean time, see
<a href="http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/302-How-to-setup-and-use-Rack-Cache-with-Rails-2-3-0-RC-1">this example of using Rack::Cache with Rails 2.3</a>.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='why-not-squid' href='#why-not-squid'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Why Rack::Cache? Why not Squid, Varnish, Perlbol, etc.?</h3>

<p><strong>Rack::Cache</strong> is often easier to setup as part of your existing Ruby
application than a separate caching system. <strong>Rack::Cache</strong> runs entirely inside
your backend application processes &ndash; no separate / external process is required.
This lets <strong>Rack::Cache</strong> scale down to development environments and simple
deployments very easily while not sacrificing the benefits of a standards-based
approach to caching.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='why-not-rails' href='#why-not-rails'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Why Rack::Cache? Why not use Rails/Merb/FrameworkX&rsquo;s caching system?</h3>

<p><strong>Rack::Cache</strong> takes a standards-based approach to caching that provides some
benefits over framework-integrated systems.  It uses standard HTTP headers
(<code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Etag</code>, <code>Last-Modified</code>, etc.) to determine
what/when to cache. Designing applications to support these standard HTTP
mechanisms gives the benefit of being able to switch to a different HTTP
cache implementation in the future.</p>

<p>In addition, using a standards-based approach to caching creates a clear
separation between application and caching logic. The application need only
specify a basic set of information about the response and all decisions
regarding how and when to cache is moved into the caching layer.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='scale' href='#scale'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Will Rack::Cache make my app scale?</h3>

<p>No. Your design is the only thing that can make your app scale.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>Rack::Cache</strong> is not overly optimized for performance. The main goal of
the project is to provide a portable, easy-to-configure, and standards-based
caching solution for small to medium sized deployments. More sophisticated /
performant caching systems (e.g., <a href="http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/">Varnish</a>, <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>,
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_cache.html">httpd/mod-cache</a>) may be more appropriate for large deployments with
crazy-land throughput requirements.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p><a class='hash' id='validation' href='#validation'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Does Rack::Cache support validation?</h3>

<p>Yes. Both freshness and validation-based caching is supported. A response
will be cached if it has a freshness lifetime (e.g., <code>Expires</code> or
<code>Cache-Control: max-age=N</code> headers) and/or includes a validator (e.g.,
<code>Last-Modified</code> or <code>ETag</code> headers). When the cache hits and the response is
fresh, it&rsquo;s delivered immediately without talking to the backend application;
when the cache is stale, the cached response is validated using a conditional
GET request.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='fragments' href='#fragments'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Does Rack::Cache support fragment caching?</h3>

<p>Not really. <strong>Rack::Cache</strong> deals with entire responses and doesn&rsquo;t know
anything about how your application constructs them.</p>

<p>However, something like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/esi-lang">ESI</a> may be implemented
in the future (likely as a separate Rack middleware component that could be
situated upstream from Rack::Cache), which would allow applications to compose
responses based on several &ldquo;fragment resources&rdquo;. Each fragment would have its
own cache policy.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='manual-purge' href='#manual-purge'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: How do I manually purge or expire a cached entry?</h3>

<p>Although planned, there is currently no mechanism for manually purging
an entry stored in the cache.</p>

<p>Note that using an <code>Expires</code> or <code>Cache-Control: max-age=N</code> header and relying on
manual purge to invalidate cached entry can often be implemented more simply
using efficient validation based caching (<code>Last-Modified</code>, <code>Etag</code>). Many web
frameworks are based entirely on manual purge and do not support validation at
the cache level.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='efficient-validation' href='#efficient-validation'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: What does &ldquo;Efficient Validation&rdquo; mean?</h3>

<p>It means that your application performs only the processing necessary to
determine if a response is valid before sending a <code>304 Not Modified</code> in response
to a conditional GET request.  Many applications that perform validation do so
only after the entire response has been generated, which provides bandwidth
savings but results in no CPU/IO savings.  Implementing validation efficiently
can increase backend application throughput significantly when fronted by a
validating caching system (like <strong>Rack::Cache</strong>).</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/9395">Here&rsquo;s an example Rack application</a> that performs
efficient validation.</p>

<h3>Q: Did you just make that up?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><a class='hash' id='https' href='#https'>#</a></p>

<h3>Q: Can I do HTTPS with Rack::Cache?</h3>

<p>Sure. HTTPS is typically managed by a front-end web server so this isn&rsquo;t really
relevant to Rack::Cache.</p>
